# Mentoring

Thank you very much for helping out with an event! Mentoring is actually quite easy and really fun.

All you need to know are the game rules, and be proficient in at least one of the languages that participants will use.

The game rules are available on the [Participate](/sections/participate) section on the left, just click on the relevant game.
